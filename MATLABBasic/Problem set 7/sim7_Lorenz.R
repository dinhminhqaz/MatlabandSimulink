# There are three model parameters: a, b, and c that are defined thirst. Parameters are stored
# as a vector with assigned names and values:
parameters <- c(a = -8/3, b = -10, c = 28)

# The three state variables are also created as a vector, and their initial values given:
state1 <- c(X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1)
state2 <- state1 + c(1e-6, 0, 0)
